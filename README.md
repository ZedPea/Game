Messing around with SDL to see if I can make something fun and practice my haskell.

The game currently does virtually nothing and can not really be called a game at all.

But hey, the close button works! And there's an FPS counter!

Stay tuned to watch me abandon this when it's no fun / I get stuck / can't think of a game idea
